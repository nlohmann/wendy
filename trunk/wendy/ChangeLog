Version 1.6
===========

* fixed bug #13994 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13994') - malicious root node
  (i.e., a root not with reachable deadlocks or message bound violation) was
  not detected

* added more test cases for synchronous communication

* added a utility to minimize operating guidelines (see `utils/minimize') -
  this is currently an adjusted branch of Rachel which needs some polishing
  towards the new file formats

* added `--bug' option to create debug output

* using generic functions to display verbose status messages

* added status messages for nets with large inner state space

Version 1.5
===========

* fixed bug #13718 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13651') - fixed bit annotations

* fixed bug #13903 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13903') - filename of the
  temporary files can be passed to Wendy using the `--tmpfile' parameter

* used `mkstemp' function to create temporary filenames

* a wrapper script checks whether binaries needed by test cases are present
  and skips the test if necessary

* added improved Petri Net API files (faster parsing)

* updated maintainer scripts

* Wendy can be configured with a configuration file, provided by parameter
  `--config' (see
  `http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html#Configuration-files'
  for more information). A standard configuration is created by the configure
  script and written to `src/wendy.conf'. When Wendy is executed, it checks
  for the file `wendy.conf' in the sysconfig folder (usually
  `/usr/local/etc') and in the current directory. If neither file was found,
  Wendy tries to rely on standard options.

Version 1.4
===========

* versions of used programs are collected in `testsuite.log' when running
  `make check'

* service automata (a.k.a. interaction graphs) can be created with `--sa'

* fixed bug #13651 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13651') - adjusted parser to
  process empty markings

* added parameter `--mi' to store a mapping between the inner marking
  identifiers (integers) to actual Petri net markings (multisets of place
  names)

* added a hidden parameter `--im' to store information needed by Mia
  (`http://service-technology.org/mia') to calculate information for instance
  migration

Version 1.3
===========

* implemented the `receive before send' reduction rule
  (`--receiveBeforeSend'): if the waitstates of a knowledge bubble can be
  resolved by receiving, don't send - this reduction does not preserve all
  strategies, but will return a strategy if one exists

* implemented the `don't send in advance' reduction rule
  (`--waitstatesOnly'): only send a message to a knowledge bubble if it
  immediately resolves a waitstate - this reduction does not preserve all
  strategies, but will return a strategy if one exists

Version 1.2
===========

* implemented new OG file format - the deprecated format can still be used
  with `--fionaFormat' parameter which is implicitly used in case `-t OG' is
  used

* added "watermark" to generated operating guidelines (generator, platform,
  invocation string)

* using a GNU Autoconf's Autotest test suite

* the configure script checks if the Petri Net API was found and only
  compiles the local copy if necessary

Version 1.1
===========

* implemented synchronous communication

* renamed `--showDeadlocks' to `--showWaitstates'

* the list of interface labels are printed when `--verbose' is used

Version 1.0
===========

* initial release of Wendy

* calculates the operating guidelines of a normal open net

* result can be written in Fiona's OG format (with explicit formulae or 2 bit
  representation)
