                      synthesizing partners for services
                      http://service-technology.org/wendy


In order to run, compile, and develop Wendy, several tools are required.

Runtime
-------

   * LoLA (`http://service-technology.org/lola'), compiled with the
     `STATESPACE' option. A suitable LoLA (version 1.14 or above) binary can
     be created as follows:
       1. download `http://service-technology.org/files/lola/lola.tar.gz'

       2. untar `lola.tar.gz', configure

       3. call `make lola-statespace'

       4. copy the binary `src/lola-statespace' to a directory of your path
          (e.g., `/usr/local/bin') or call `make install'

     If LoLA is not installed before Wendy is configured, a source release of
     LoLA is automatically downloaded and compiled.

Wendy's configure script checks whether LoLA (with binary `lola-statespace')
is found in the path and adjusts the configuration file `src/wendy.conf'
accordingly.

Compilation
-----------

To compile the source code from a source distribution, the following tools are
required.

   * GCC (`http://gcc.gnu.org/') or Clang (`http://clang.llvm.org/')

   * GNU Make (`http://www.gnu.org/software/make/')

Development
-----------

In case you want to make changes to the source code, the following tools are
required to reconfigure and compile Wendy.

   * Autoconf, `http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/'

   * Automake, `http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/'

   * Bison, `http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/'

   * flex, `http://flex.sourceforge.net/'

   * Gengetopt, `http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/'

   * help2man, `http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/'

   * Texinfo, `http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/'
