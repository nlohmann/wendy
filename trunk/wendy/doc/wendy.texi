@node First Steps
@chapter First Steps

@section Setup and Installation

@enumerate
@item Go to @url{http://service-technology.org/files/wendy} and download the latest release version of Wendy, say @file{wendy-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz}. To setup and compile Wendy, change into your download directory and type

@cartouche
@smallexample
tar xfz wendy-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
cd wendy-@value{VERSION}
./configure
make
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

After compilation, a binary @samp{src/wendy} is generated.@footnote{On Microsoft Windows, the file will be called @file{wendy.exe}.} If you experience any compiler warnings, don't panic: Wendy contains some generated or third party code that we cannot influence.

@item To test whether everything went fine, type

@cartouche
@smallexample
make check
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

to execute the testcases located in @file{tests}. If everything went fine, you should see something like:@footnote{Some tests use Fiona to check whether the calculated operating guidelines are correct. If Fiona was not found by the configure script, theses tests are skipped.}

@smallexample
## ------------- ##
## Test results. ##
## ------------- ##

All 83 tests were successful.
@end smallexample

If an error occurs, please send the output to @email{wendy@@service-technology.org}.

@item To install the binary, the manpage, and the documentation, type

@cartouche
@smallexample
make install
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

You might need superuser permissions to do so.
@end enumerate

If you need any further information, see file @file{INSTALL} for detailed instructions.


@section Contents of the Distribution

The distribution contains several directories:

@table @file
@item doc
The Texinfo documentation of Wendy. The documentation can be created using @samp{make pdf}. Note you need to have Wendy properly installed before (see installation description above).

@item libs
The Petri Net @acronym{API} used by Wendy to parse and organize the open net.

@item man
The manpage of Wendy which can be displayed using @samp{man wendy} after having Wendy installed (see installation description above).

@item src
The source code of Wendy.

@item tests
Testcases for Wendy which check the generated binary. Some test scripts use Fiona to check whether the calculated operating guidelines are correct. If Fiona was not found by the configure script, theses tests are skipped.
@end table

@section Requirements
@anchor{Requirements}

@c !!! DO NOT CHANGE THE NEXT LINE -- IT IS USED AS A FILTER IN SCRIPTS !!!
In order to run, compile, and develop Wendy, several tools are required.

@subsection Runtime
@itemize
@item LoLA (@url{http://service-technology.org/lola}), compiled with the @samp{STATESPACE} option. A suitable LoLA binary can be created as follows:
@enumerate
@item download @url{http://service-technology.org/files/lola/lola.tar.gz}
@item untar @file{lola.tar.gz}, configure
@item call @samp{make lola-statespace}
@item copy the binary @file{src/lola-statespace} to a directory of your path
(e.g., @file{/usr/local/bin}) or call @samp{make install}
@end enumerate
@end itemize

Wendy's configure script checks whether LoLA (with binary @file{lola-statespace}) is found in the path and adjusts the configuration file @file{src/wendy.conf} accordingly.


@subsection Compilation
To compile the source code from a source distribution, the following tools are required.

@itemize
@item GCC (@url{http://gcc.gnu.org/})
@item @acronym{GNU} Make (@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/make/})
@end itemize


@subsection Development
In case you want to make changes to the source code, the following tools are required to reconfigure and compile Wendy.

@itemize
@item Autoconf, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/}
@item Automake, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/}
@item Bison, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/}
@item flex, @url{http://flex.sourceforge.net/}
@item Gengetopt, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/}
@item help2man, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/}
@item Texinfo, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/}
@end itemize

@node Command Line Options
@chapter Invoking Wendy

Wendy is a command line tool and does not come with a fancy @acronym{GUI}. However, Wendy can be easily scripted and combined with other tools.

@section Command Line Options

For an overview of the command line options, type @samp{wendy -h} to see the following help screen:

@smallexample
@verbatiminclude cmdline.out
@end smallexample


@section Configuration Files

The parameters can also be controlled using a configuration file that can be read using the @samp{config} option; for example:

@cartouche
@smallexample
wendy net.owfn --config=myconf.conf
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

A configuration file consistes of @code{paramter = value} lines, each line setting the value of a parameter. Note: If not all parameters are defined, the standard values apply.

The configure script creates a default configuration file @file{wendy.conf} which located in the @file{src} folder. When installing Wendy, this is copied to your sysconfig directory (usually @file{/usr/local/etc}).

When Wendy is executed, it evaluates parameters as follows:
@enumerate
@item When a configuration file is given via @option{--config}, it is used.
@item Otherwise, the configuration file @file{wendy.conf} in the local directory is used if present.
@item Otherwise, the configuration file @file{wendy.conf} in the sysconf directory (usually @file{/usr/local/etc}) is used if present.
@item Otherwise, no configuration file is used.
@end enumerate
Parameters given via command-line will overwrite parameters given via configuration files.


@section Compatibility to Fiona

@multitable @columnfractions .5 .5
@headitem Wendy @tab Fiona
@item @code{wendy net.owfn} @tab @code{fiona net.owfn -t OG -Q}
@item @code{wendy net.owfn --og} @tab @code{fiona net.owfn -t OG -p no-dot}
@item @code{wendy net.owfn --og --dot} @tab @code{fiona net.owfn -t OG -p no-png}

@node Exit and Error Codes
@chapter Exit and Error Codes


@section Exit Codes

Wendy will exit with code @samp{0} in case everything went fine. That is, the command-line parameters were valid, the input open net could be read, the reachability graph of the inner could be build, the operating guidelines could be calculated, and---if requested---output files could be successfully written. In case any error occurs, the exit code will be @samp{1} and an error message with an error code (see below) will be printed to the standard error stream.

Note that Wendy's exit code is @b{not} related to the result of the controllability result. The messages

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: net is controllable: YES
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

and

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: net is controllable: NO
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

both yield exit code @samp{0} (successful termination).


@section Error Codes

In case any error occurs, Wendy aborts with exit code @samp{1} and prints a message with an error code to the standard error stream.

@table @asis
@item #01
Error opening the input open net or input file not found.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: could not open file `foo.owfn' -- aborting [#01]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #02
Error parsing the input open net. Usually indicates the line of the error and some more or less helpful message on the parse error.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy:13: error near `Place': syntax error, unexpected IDENT,
          expecting KEY_INTERFACE or KEY_PLACE -- aborting [#02]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #03
The input open net is not normal. That is, it contains a transition that is connected to more than one interface place. Note that non-normal open net can be normalized using the frontend tool @samp{petri} of the Petri Net @acronym{API}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: the input open net must be normal -- aborting [#03]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #04
At most one file can be read at once. If no input filename is given, the open net is read from standard input.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: at most one input file must be given -- aborting [#04]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #05
@i{This parameter is deprecated since version 1.5.}

@item #06
This error occurs in case Wendy could not parse the reachability graph from LoLA. This might happen if a wrong version of LoLA (e.g., not using the @samp{STATESPACE} mode, see @ref{Requirements}) is used or LoLA runs out of memory. To get the exact parse error, use the command-line option @samp{--verbose}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: error while parsing the reachability graph -- aborting [#06]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #07
A wrong command-line parameter was given or there was a problem with the combination of command-line parameters. This message is usually accompanied by another message describing the exact problem. Run @samp{wendy --help} for an overview of the valid command-line parameters.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: `--showEmptyNode' option depends on option `dot'
wendy: invalid command-line parameter(s) -- aborting [#07]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #08
The report frequency for built knowledges must be a positive number. To switch off reporting at all, use @samp{--reportFrequency=0}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: report frequency must not be negative -- aborting [#08]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #09
Interface markings are stored in byte vectors, so the marking of each place has to be stored in one byte. Hence, the message bound must not exceed 255.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: message bound must be between 1 and 255 -- aborting [#09]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #10
The 2-bit annotations (@option{--formula=2bit}) currently do not support synchronous communication. Only operating guidelines with classical formulae (@option{--formula=dnf}) can be calculated if the open net uses synchronous communication.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: 2-bit annotations must not be used with
       synchronous communication -- aborting [#10]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #11
Error opening a file to write. Usually, this error occurs in case Wendy is called in a directory without writing permissions or the output file is already present, but write protected. Output files can be the target files of the @option{--og} or @option{--dot} parameter as well as the temporary LoLA file @file{tmp.lola} or the generated cover constraint file @file{ogfile.cover}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: could not write to file `foo.og' -- aborting [#11]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #12
Wendy can either create operating guidelines or a service automaton. The options @option{--og} and @option{--sa} are mutually exclusive.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: `--og' and `--sa' parameter are mutually exclusive -- aborting [#12]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #13
Wendy cannot create a temporary file @file{/tmp/wendy-XXXXXX}, where @samp{XXXXXX} is replaced by a unique name. If this error occurs, check whether the @file{/tmp} folder exists and you have the rights to write there. One reason for this error can be that you are running Wendy under Windows (outside Cygwin), where UNIX-style path names are not recognized. In that case, try using the @option{--tmpfile} parameter.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: could not create a temporary file `/tmp/wendy-k4CS4x' -- aborting [#13]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #14
Wendy cannot find the configuration file given by @file{--config} parameter or it has syntax errors. For an example configuration file, see the standard configuration file @file{src/wendy.conf} created by the configure script. See @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html#Configuration-files} for more information on configuration file.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: Error opening configuration file `myconf.conf'
wendy: error reading configuration file `myconf.conf' -- aborting [#14]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #15
Wendy cannot find the cover file given by @option{--cover} parameter or it has syntax errors. 

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: could not open cover file `foo.cov' -- aborting [#15]
wendy: error while parsing the cover file -- aborting [#15]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #16
A node that has to be covered (by using the @option{--cover} parameter) does not occur in the given net.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: unknown place `p' in file `foo.cov' -- aborting [#16]
wendy: unknown transition `t' in file `foo.cov' -- aborting [#16]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@end table

@node ChangeLog
@chapter Version History

@c !!! DO NOT CHANGE THE NEXT LINE -- IT IS USED AS A FILTER IN SCRIPTS !!!
Wendy is developed under the ``Release Early, Release Often'' maxime (see @url{http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html}): Whenever enough integrated or a non-trivial changes have summed up, a new version is published. Though this releases might now always mark significant changes, they at least allow to quickly fix bugs and avoid infinite procrastination.
