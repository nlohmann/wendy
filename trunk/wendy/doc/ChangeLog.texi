@end itemize


@heading Version 2.0 (26 August 2009)
@itemize
@item removed parameter @samp{--noDeadlockDetection}

@item reorganized internal livelock detection; avoided additional bit to be stored for each internal marking

@item fixed bug #14166 (@url{https://gna.org/bugs/?14166}): adding dead dummy transition to avoid parser errors from LoLA

@item added scripts to use LCOV (@url{http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php}) to determine test case coverage (use @samp{make cover} in @file{tests} directory)

@item added test cases to test Wendy's integration into Mia (@url{http://service-technology.org/mia})

@item solved task #6701 (@url{https://gna.org/task/?6701}): output files (including temporary files) are now organized by dedicated class; @samp{mktemp} function is used due to portability issues

@item output can be piped to standard output (@code{stdout}) by using the filename @file{-}; example: @samp{wendy file.owfn --og=-}

@item generated temporary files are deleted if the @option{--clean} parameter is given

@item fixed bug #14158 (@url{https://gna.org/bugs/?14158}): removed conflicts in graph grammar
@end itemize


@heading Version 1.9 (21 August 2009)
@itemize
@item added file @file{THEORY} listing the scientific algorithms and results implemented in Wendy

@item implemented cover constraints for operating guidelines (parameter @option{--cover}); see file @file{THEORY} for more information

@item canonized Makefiles and indicated which parts are purely generic

@item refined statistics on the nodes: how many nodes were deleted and how many nodes remained? -- adjusted test cases accordingly

@item implemented the generation of livelock free partners (not yet operating guidelines); here, LoLA has to be configured appropriately by using directive STATESPACE rather than FULL (make lola-statespace) and the configuration file of Wendy has to be adjusted accordingly 

@item added test cases for livelock freedom

@item fixed bug #14150 (@url{https://gna.org/bugs/?14150}): empty node is only printed if it is reachable from the initial node

@item updated maintainer scripts to support Launchpad

@item implemented reduction rule ``smart sending event'' (parameter: @option{--smartSendingEvent}): a sending event is only considered if from the inner markings within the current knowledge (1) in case of deadlock freedom, some (inner) marking is reachable; (2) in case of livelock freedom, a final (inner) marking is reachable.

@item added test cases for reduction rule ``smart sending event''

@item updated author/copyright information

@item enhanced early insane node detection when reduction rule ``smart sending event'' is switched on; here for each full marking contained within a knowledge it is checked whether from the corresponding inner marking a transition is reachable that will consume an input message lying on the interface
@end itemize


@heading Version 1.8 (13 August 2009)
@itemize
@item implemented reduction rule ``sequentializing receiving events'' (parameter: @option{--seqReceivingEvents}): instead of receiving messages in any order, only one sequentialization is considered. (A similar rule is implemented in Fiona where receiving events where combined rather than sequentialized.)

@item implemented reduction rule ``succeeding sending event'' (parameter: @option{--succeedingSendingEvent}): once a sending event has led from the current knowledge to a valid successor knowledge, we do not consider any other sending event leaving the current knowledge

@item fixed @option{--bug} parameter which caused segmentation faults on some machines

@item added test cases for the reduction rules

@item imported fixed Petri Net API: bug #14116 (@url{https://gna.org/bugs/?14116}) yielded incorrect results, because Wendy did not recognize unnormal input files
@end itemize


@heading Version 1.7 (10 August 2009)
@itemize
@item added test case for bug #13903 (@url{https://gna.org/bugs/?13903})

@item fixed bug #14025 (@url{https://gna.org/bugs/?14025}): the Dot output had problems with nonempty knowledge with true annotation

@item fixed bug #14067 (@url{https://gna.org/bugs/?14067}): a change in the Petri Net API broke the evaluation of final conditions

@item added new version of the Petri Net API (after fixing bug #13844 (@url{http://gna.org/bugs/?13844})

@item made some adjustments which allow for a native Windows compilation (independent of @file{cygwin1.dll})

@item added details to the man page; a PDF version of the man page can be created with @samp{make man-pdf} in the @file{man} directory (requires groff and ps2pdf)

@item small fix to allow compilation under x86_64 architectures
@end itemize


@heading Version 1.6 (21 July 2009)
@itemize
@item fixed bug #13994 (@url{https://gna.org/bugs/?13994}) -- malicious root node (i.e., a root not with reachable deadlocks or message bound violation) was not detected

@item added more test cases for synchronous communication

@item added a utility to minimize operating guidelines (see @file{utils/minimize}) -- this is currently an adjusted branch of Rachel which needs some polishing towards the new file formats
@item added @option{--bug} option to create debug output

@item using generic functions to display verbose status messages

@item added status messages for nets with large inner state space
@end itemize


@heading Version 1.5 (9 July 2009)
@itemize
@item fixed bug #13718 (@url{https://gna.org/bugs/?13651}) -- fixed bit annotations

@item fixed bug #13903 (@url{https://gna.org/bugs/?13903}) -- filename of the temporary files can be passed to Wendy using the @option{--tmpfile} parameter

@item used @code{mkstemp} function to create temporary filenames

@item a wrapper script checks whether binaries needed by test cases are present and skips the test if necessary

@item added improved Petri Net API files (faster parsing)

@item updated maintainer scripts

@item Wendy can be configured with a configuration file, provided by parameter @option{--config} (see @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html#Configuration-files} for more information). A standard configuration is created by the configure script and written to @file{src/wendy.conf}. When Wendy is executed, it checks for the file @file{wendy.conf} in the sysconfig folder (usually @file{/usr/local/etc}) and in the current directory. If neither file was found, Wendy tries to rely on standard options.
@end itemize


@heading Version 1.4 (15 June 2009)
@itemize
@item versions of used programs are collected in @file{testsuite.log} when running @samp{make check}

@item service automata (a.k.a. interaction graphs) can be created with @option{--sa}

@item fixed bug #13651 (@url{https://gna.org/bugs/?13651}) -- adjusted parser to process empty markings

@item added parameter @option{--mi} to store a mapping between the inner marking identifiers (integers) to actual Petri net markings (multisets of place names)

@item added a hidden parameter @option{--im} to store information needed by Mia (@url{http://service-technology.org/mia}) to calculate information for instance migration
@end itemize


@heading Version 1.3 (22 May 2009)
@itemize
@item implemented the `receive before send' reduction rule (@option{--receiveBeforeSend}): if the waitstates of a knowledge bubble can be resolved by receiving, don't send -- this reduction does not preserve all strategies, but will return a strategy if one exists

@item implemented the `don't send in advance' reduction rule (@option{--waitstatesOnly}): only send a message to a knowledge bubble if it immediately resolves a waitstate -- this reduction does not preserve all strategies, but will return a strategy if one exists
@end itemize


@heading Version 1.2 (20 May 2009)
@itemize
@item implemented new OG file format -- the deprecated format can still be used with @option{--fionaFormat} parameter which is implicitly used in case @option{-t OG} is used

@item added "watermark" to generated operating guidelines (generator, platform, invocation string)

@item using a @acronym{GNU} Autoconf's Autotest test suite

@item the configure script checks if the Petri Net @acronym{API} was found and only compiles the local copy if necessary
@end itemize


@heading Version 1.1 (12 May 2009)
@itemize
@item implemented synchronous communication

@item renamed @option{--showDeadlocks} to @option{--showWaitstates}

@item the list of interface labels are printed when @option{--verbose} is used
@end itemize


@heading Version 1.0 (11 May 2009)
@itemize
@item initial release of Wendy

@item calculates the operating guidelines of a normal open net

@item result can be written in Fiona's OG format (with explicit formulae or 2 bit representation)
