  "tagline": "synthesizing partners for services",
  "purpose": "Wendy is a tool to synthesize partners for services. This includes a finite characterization of all partners (called \"operating guidelines\"). Wendy uses a vast set of reduction rules to synthesize (small) partners. These rules may, however, not preserve all partners of the service under consideration, but will synthesize a partner if one exists.",

  "authors": [
    "Niels Lohmann implemented the original core functionality of Wendy (operating guidelines)",
    "Daniela Weinberg implemented reduction techniques as well as the synthesis of livelock free strategies",
    "Christian Sura implemented the functions to cover open nets nodes"

    "Thanks to Marc Voorhoeve for reporting some bugs running Wendy in a native (non-Cygwin) Windows environment.",
    "Thanks to Christian Gierds for testing Wendy with strange nets that revealed several really subtle bugs.",
    "Thanks to Dirk Fahland for pointing out a problem in the STL sorting algorithm which led to a segmentation fault.",
    "Thanks to Mike Hordecki for a post on Stack Overflow with a portable preprocessor macro to iterate C++ containers (see 'src/util.h')."
