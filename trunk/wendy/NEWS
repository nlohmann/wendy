Version 2.7-unreleased
======================

* configure Wendy with `--enable-syslog' to additionally write verbose
  output to the syslog (e.g. `/var/log/system.log')

* `--reportFrequency' sets the number of edges to be reported (was: number
  of knowledges)

* fixed bug #14922 (see `https://gna.org/bugs/?14922'): Wendy could not
  process markings with Unicode place names which yielded a crash when
  using `--mi'
