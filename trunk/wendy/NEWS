Version 3.2-unreleased
======================

* test scripts now use the `petri' utility to convert automata to open nets

* added target to create complete manual (execute `make manual -C doc')

* updated the Petri Net API 4.02 (revision r5970)

* updated LCOV (`http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php') to 1.9 and
  removed ZCOV, because LCOV can do branch coverage as well

* added `silence' utility to implement reduction of internal actions

* implemented `--internalReduction' parameter to reduce internal actions
  using the algorithm described in

       Niels Lohmann. Internal behavior reduction for partner synthesis. In
       Daniel Eichhorn, Agnes Koschmider, and Huayu Zhang, editors,
       Proceedings of the 3rd Central-European Workshop on Services and
       their Composition, ZEUS 2011, Karlsruhe, Germany, February 21-22,
       2011, volume 705 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings, March 2011.
       CEUR-WS.org.

* adjusted configure script to download and compile LoLA if it is not found
  in the path

* Wendy creates an extended CTL formula which is added to the intermediate
  LoLA output. It is used to apply CTL*-preserving partial order reduction
  when building the state space of the inner of the net. The formula is
  used to tell LoLA which transitions are visible; that is, which
  transitions must not be ignored during reduction.

* fixed bug #17896 (see `https://gna.org/bugs/?17896'): crash on empty
  input nets

* LoLA is now automatically downloaded and compiled if the configure script
  does not find an installed version.
