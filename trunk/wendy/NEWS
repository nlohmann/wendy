Version 1.9-unreleased
======================

* added file `THEORY' listing the scientific algorithms and results
  implemented in Wendy

* implemented cover constraints for operating guidelines (parameter
  `--cover'); see file `THEORY' for more information

* canonized Makefiles and indicated which parts are purely generic

* refined statistics on the nodes: how many nodes were deleted and how many
  nodes remained? - adjusted test cases accordingly

* implemented the generation of livelock free partners (not yet operating
  guidelines); here, LoLA has to be configured appropriately by using
  directive STATESPACE rather than FULL (make lola-statespace) and the
  configuration file of Wendy has to be adjusted accordingly

* added test cases for livelock freedom
