Version 3.2-unreleased
======================

* test scripts now use the `petri' utility to convert automata to open nets

* added target to create complete manual (execute `make manual -C doc')

* updated the Petri Net API 4.02 (revision r5970)

* updated LCOV (`http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php') to 1.9 and
  removed ZCOV, because LCOV can do branch coverage as well

* added `silence' utility to implement reduction of internal actions

* implemented `--internalReduction' parameter to reduce internal actions

* adjusted configure script to download and compile LoLA if it is not found
  in the path

* Wendy creates an extended CTL formula which is added to the intermediate
  LoLA output. It is used to apply CTL*-preserving partial order reduction
  when building the state space of the inner of the net. The formula is
  used to tell LoLA which transitions are visible; that is, which
  transitions must not be ignored during reduction.
