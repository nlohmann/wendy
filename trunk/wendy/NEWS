Version 2.4 (9 November 2009)
=============================

* added target for benchmarks (execute `make bench -C tests')

* implemented new 3-bit representation: at `T' bit is necessary to
  correctly cope with "true"-annotated nodes - renamed `2bits' option to
  `bits'

* removed explicit `std::flush' calls

* colored status messages

* fixed bug #14693 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14693'): wrong propagation of
  final states yielded wrong results for livelock freedom
