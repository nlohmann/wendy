Version 3.0-unreleased
======================

* introducing the livelock operating guideline: use `--correctness=livelock
  --og' to calculate the livelock operating guideline with appropriate
  annotations which are then printed out in the og-file; providing
  parameter `--dot' prints the respective annotations in the dot output

* implemented parameter `--pnml' to read a PNML file format

* moved the utility to minimize operating guidelines to the `ogapi' trunk
  (see `http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/service-tech/trunk/ogapi/')

* added a tool paper with a case study (see `doc/toolpaper.pdf')

* Wendy now checks whether it can use an installed version of the Petri Net
  API (`libpnapi') and only compiles its shipped version (see `libs/pnapi')
  if the installed version is missing, the installed version cannot be
  linked (e.g., due to a wrong architecture), or the configure script
  option `--without-pnapi' is used.
