Version 2.5 (21 November 2009)
==============================

* Wendy expects LoLA to omit printing out statistical data; usage of LoLA
  1.14 is required

* fixed bug #14798 (see `https://gna.org/bugs/?14798'): smart sending is
  too strict (now fix of bug #14782 is obsolete and is handled with the new
  implementation)

* fixed bug #14782 (see `https://gna.org/bugs/?14782'): smart sending event
  does not handle self loops of inner markings correctly

* added an error message to avoid segmentation faults in case a marking has
  two outgoing transitions with the same synchronous label (see
  `https://gna.org/bugs/?14719')
