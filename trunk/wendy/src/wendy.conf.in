# This file configures the paths to binaries needed by Wendy. The configure
# script already tried to suggest paths, but it entries might have been left
# empty. In that case, you need to manually add the path to the respective
# tool.

# Wendy needs a LoLA binary that builds complete unreduced state spaces. Such
# a LoLA binary can be built by executing "make lola-full" using a recent
# LoLA distribution, available at http://service-technology.org/files/lola.

lola = @LOLA@

# Wendy needs to create a temporary file to pass it to LoLA. The filename
# Wendy should use can be specified below. The filename should end with
# 'XXXXXX' which is replaced at runtime with a random string.

tmpfile = /tmp/wendy-XXXXXX
