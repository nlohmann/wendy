Version 2.0-unreleased
======================

* removed parameter `--noDeadlockDetection'

* reorganized internal livelock detection; avoided additional bit to be
  stored for each internal marking

* fixed bug #14166 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14166'): adding dead dummy
  transition to avoid parser errors from LoLA

* added scripts to use LCOV
  (`http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php') to determine test case
  coverage (use `make cover' in `tests' directory)

* added test cases to test Wendy's integration into Mia
  (`http://service-technology.org/mia')

* solved task #6701 (`https://gna.org/task/?6701'): output files (including
  temporary files) are now organized by dedicated class; `mktemp' function
  is used due to portability issues

* output can be piped to standard output (`stdout') by using the filename
  `-'; example: `wendy file.owfn --og=-'

* generated temporary files are deleted if the `--clean' parameter is given

* fixed bug #14158 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14158'): removed conflicts in
  graph grammar
