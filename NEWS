Version 1.5-unreleased
======================

* fixed bug #13718 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13651') - fixed bit annotations

* fixed bug #13903 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13903') - filename of the
  temporary files can be passed to Wendy using the `--tmpfile' parameter

* used `mkstemp' function to create temporary filenames

* a wrapper script checks whether binaries needed by test cases are present
  and skips the test if necessary

* added improved Petri Net API files (faster parsing)

* updated maintainer scripts

* Wendy can be configured with a configuration file, provided by parameter
  `--config' (see
  `http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html#Configuration-files'
  for more information). A standard configuration is created by the configure
  script and written to `src/wendy.conf'. When Wendy is executed, it checks
  for the file `wendy.conf' in the sysconfig folder (usually
  `/usr/local/etc') and in the current directory. If neither file was found,
  Wendy tries to rely on standard options.
