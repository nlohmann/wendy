Version 1.8-unreleased
======================

* implemented reduction rule "sequentializing receiving events" (parameter:
  `--seqReceivingEvents'): instead of receiving messages in any order, only
  one sequentialization is considered. (A similar rule is implemented in
  Fiona where receiving events where combined rather than sequentialized.)

* implemented reduction rule "succeeding sending event" (parameter:
  `--succeedingSendingEvent'): once a sending event has led from the current
  knowledge to a valid successor knowledge, we do not consider any other
  sending event leaving the current knowledge

* fixed `--bug' parameter which caused segmentation faults on some machines

* imported fixed Petri Net API: bug #14116 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14116')
  yielded incorrect results, because Wendy did not recognize unnormal input
  files
