Version 1.3
===========

* implemented the `receive before send' reduction rule
  (`--receiveBeforeSend'): if the waitstates of a knowledge bubble can be
  resolved by receiving, don't send - this reduction does not preserve all
  strategies, but will return a strategy if one exists

* implemented the `don't send in advance' reduction rule
  (`--waitstatesOnly'): only send a message to a knowledge bubble if it
  immediately resolves a waitstate - this reduction does not preserve all
  strategies, but will return a strategy if one exists
