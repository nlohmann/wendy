Version 1.9-unreleased
======================

* added file `THEORY' listing the scientific algorithms and results
  implemented in Wendy

* implemented cover constraints for operating guidelines (parameter
  `--cover'); see file `THEORY' for more information

* canonized Makefiles and indicated which parts are purely generic

* refined statistics on the nodes: how many nodes were deleted and how many
  nodes remained? - adjusted test cases accordingly

* implemented the generation of livelock free partners (not yet operating
  guidelines); here, LoLA has to be configured appropriately by using
  directive STATESPACE rather than FULL (make lola-statespace) and the
  configuration file of Wendy has to be adjusted accordingly

* added test cases for livelock freedom

* fixed bug #14150 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14150'): empty node is only
  printed if it is reachable from the initial node

* updated maintainer scripts to support Launchpad

* implemented reduction rule "smart sending event" (parameter:
  `--smartSendingEvent'): a sending event is only considered if from the
  inner markings within the current knowledge (1) in case of deadlock
  freedom, some (inner) marking is reachable; (2) in case of livelock
  freedom, a final (inner) marking is reachable.

* added test cases for reduction rule "smart sending event"

* updated author/copyright information
