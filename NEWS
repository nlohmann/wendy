Version 2.0-unreleased
======================

* removed parameter `--noDeadlockDetection'

* reorganized internal livelock detection; avoided additional bit to be
  stored for each internal marking

* fixed bug #14166 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14166'): adding dead dummy
  transition to avoid parser errors from LoLA

* added scripts to use LCOV
  (`http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php') to determine test case
  coverage (use `make cover' in `tests' directory)

* current test case coverage:
     * lines: 73.6% (3094 of 4202 lines)

     * functions: 82.0% (1967 of 2398 functions)

* refined test cases to increase test case coverage
