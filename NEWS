Version 2.2-unreleased
======================

* added test cases for checking synchronous communication together with
  livelock freedom and reduction rule "quit as soon as possible"
  (parameter: `--quitAsSoonAsPossible')

* added test cases to test Wendy's integration into Marlene

* no output files are created in case of uncontrollability (unless
  `--diagnose' is given)

* implemented parameter `--stats' to display information on runtime and
  memory consumption (the latter uses `ps' and does not work under Cygwin)
