@node First Steps
@chapter First Steps

@section Setup and Installation

@enumerate
@item Go to @url{http://service-technology.org/files/wendy} and download the latest release version of Wendy, say @file{wendy-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz}. To setup and compile Wendy, change into your download directory and type

@cartouche
@smallexample
tar xfz wendy-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
cd wendy-@value{VERSION}
./configure
make
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

After compilation, a binary @samp{src/wendy} is generated.@footnote{On Microsoft Windows, the file will be called @file{wendy.exe}.} If you experience any compiler warnings, don't panic: Wendy contains some generated or third party code that we cannot influence.

@item To test whether everything went fine, type

@cartouche
@smallexample
make check
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

to execute the testcases located in @file{tests}. If everything went fine, you should see something like:@footnote{Some tests use Fiona to check whether the calculated operating guidelines are correct. If Fiona was not found by the configure script, theses tests are skipped.}

@smallexample
## ------------- ##
## Test results. ##
## ------------- ##

All 104 tests were successful.
@end smallexample

If an error occurs, please send the output to @email{wendy@@service-technology.org}.

@item To install the binary, the manpage, and the documentation, type

@cartouche
@smallexample
make install
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

You might need superuser permissions to do so.
@end enumerate

If you need any further information, see file @file{INSTALL} for detailed instructions.


@section Contents of the Distribution

The distribution contains several directories:

@table @file
@item doc
The Texinfo documentation of Wendy. The documentation can be created using @samp{make pdf}. Note you need to have Wendy properly installed before (see installation description above).

@item libs
The Petri Net @acronym{API} used by Wendy to parse and organize the open net.

@item man
The manpage of Wendy which can be displayed using @samp{man wendy} after having Wendy installed (see installation description above).

@item src
The source code of Wendy.

@item tests
Testcases for Wendy which check the generated binary. Some test scripts use Fiona to check whether the calculated operating guidelines are correct. If Fiona was not found by the configure script, theses tests are skipped.
@end table




@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------


@section Requirements
@anchor{Requirements}

@c !!! DO NOT CHANGE THE NEXT LINE -- IT IS USED AS A FILTER IN SCRIPTS !!!
In order to run, compile, and develop Wendy, several tools are required.

@subsection Runtime
@itemize
@item LoLA (@url{http://service-technology.org/lola}), compiled with the @samp{STATESPACE} option. A suitable LoLA (version 1.14 or above) binary can be created as follows:
@enumerate
@item download @url{http://service-technology.org/files/lola/lola.tar.gz}
@item untar @file{lola.tar.gz}, configure
@item call @samp{make lola-statespace}
@item copy the binary @file{src/lola-statespace} to a directory of your path
(e.g., @file{/usr/local/bin}) or call @samp{make install}
@end enumerate

If LoLA is not installed before Wendy is configured, a source release of LoLA is automatically downloaded and compiled.
@end itemize

Wendy's configure script checks whether LoLA (with binary @file{lola-statespace}) is found in the path and adjusts the configuration file @file{src/wendy.conf} accordingly.


@subsection Compilation
To compile the source code from a source distribution, the following tools are required.

@itemize
@item GCC (@url{http://gcc.gnu.org/}) or Clang (@url{http://clang.llvm.org/})
@item @acronym{GNU} Make (@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/make/})
@end itemize


@subsection Development
In case you want to make changes to the source code, the following tools are required to reconfigure and compile Wendy.

@itemize
@item Autoconf, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/}
@item Automake, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/}
@item Bison, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/}
@item flex, @url{http://flex.sourceforge.net/}
@item Gengetopt, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/}
@item help2man, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/}
@item Texinfo, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/}
@end itemize


@sp 3

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------


@node Command Line Options
@chapter Invoking Wendy

Wendy is a command line tool and does not come with a fancy @acronym{GUI}. However, Wendy can be easily scripted and combined with other tools.

@section Command Line Options

For an overview of the command line options, type @samp{wendy -h} to see the following help screen:

@smallexample
@verbatiminclude cmdline.out
@end smallexample


@section Configuration Files

The parameters can also be controlled using a configuration file that can be read using the @samp{config} option; for example:

@cartouche
@smallexample
wendy net.owfn --config=myconf.conf
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

A configuration file consistes of @code{paramter = value} lines, each line setting the value of a parameter. Note: If not all parameters are defined, the standard values apply.

The configure script creates a default configuration file @file{wendy.conf} which located in the @file{src} folder. When installing Wendy, this is copied to your sysconfig directory (usually @file{/usr/local/etc}).

When Wendy is executed, it evaluates parameters as follows:
@enumerate
@item When a configuration file is given via @option{--config}, it is used.
@item Otherwise, the configuration file @file{wendy.conf} in the local directory is used if present.
@item Otherwise, the configuration file @file{wendy.conf} in the sysconf directory (usually @file{/usr/local/etc}) is used if present.
@item Otherwise, no configuration file is used.
@end enumerate
Parameters given via command-line will overwrite parameters given via configuration files.


@section Compatibility to Fiona

Since Wendy Version 2.6, direct support of Fiona's file format has been discontinued. Instead, a compiler @code{wendy2fiona} can translate Wendy's OG output into Fiona's file format.

@node Results
@chapter Results

@heading @code{controllability}
@findex controllability

This part lists the main results of the controllability analysis.

@ftable @code
@item correctness
The checked correctness criterion of the analysis: @code{"deadlock freedom"} or @code{"weak termination"}. [String]

@item message_bound
The message bound used during controllability analysis. [Integer]

@item result
The results of the controllability analysis: @code{true} if the net is controllable and @code{false} if the net is uncontrollable. [Boolean]
@end ftable


@heading @code{meta}
@findex meta

This part lists information on the tool itself.

@ftable @code
@item invocation
The invocation string of the tool. [String]

@item package_name
@itemx package_version
@itemx svn_version
The name of the tool, its version, and (when applicable) the version of the SVN revision. [String]
@end ftable


@heading @code{statistics}
@findex statistics

This part lists all kind of information and statistics that can be relevant for debugging or optimization purposes. These information are, however, rather technical and might only be interesting for developers.

@ftable @code
@item edges
The number of computed edges between nodes. Note: this number may also include edges to insane nodes. [Integer]

@item events
@itemx events_receive
@itemx events_send
@itemx events_synchronous
The total number of events and the number of receive, send, and synchronous events, respectively. This number is directly derived from the input open net. [Integer]

@item hash_buckets_capacity
The total number of hash buckets (i.e., the length of the hash table). This number is influenced by the type @samp{hash_t} that is defined in @file{src/types.h}. [Integer]

@item hash_buckets_maximal_size
The maximal number of entries stored in a single hash bucket. Any value greater than one means that there was a hash collision which might increase runtime. [Integer]

@item hash_buckets_used
The number of hash buckets used. Useful to evaluate hash functions. [Integer]

@item inner_markings
The number of inner markings (i.e., the size of the reachability graph) of the input open net. [Integer]

@item inner_markings_bad
The number of inner markings that are identified as bad during preprocessing. A bad marking can be a non-final deadlock. When the correctness criterion is set to weak termination, also markings of terminal strongly connected components without final markings (i.e., livelocks) are considered bad. [Integer]

@item inner_markings_final
The number of reachable markings of the inner that satisfy the final condition of the input open net. [Integer]

@item inner_markings_inevitable_bad
A marking is inevitably bad if it is neither bad nor final, but all its successor markings are bad or inevitably bad. [Integer]

@item nodes
The total number of stored nodes (i.e., objects of type @samp{StoredKnowledge}) during analysis. [Integer]

@item nodes_insane
The total number of stored nodes (i.e., objects of type @samp{StoredKnowledge}) that were identified insane after building. [Integer]

@item nodes_sane
The total number of stored nodes (i.e., objects of type @samp{StoredKnowledge}) that were not identified insane after building. Only these nodes will be considered when creating files. [Integer]

@item queue_maximal_length
The maximal number of full markings (i.e., objects of type @samp{FullMarking}) that were queued during the calculation of a closure. [Integer]

@item queue_maximal_queues
The maximal number of queues that were stored at the same time. This number coincides with the depth of the recursion of the main algorithm (i.e., the depth-first building of knowledges) and the number of concurrently stored objects of type @samp{Knowledge}. [Integer]

@item scc_maximal_size
The size of the largest strongly connected component of the nodes. [Integer]

@item scc_nontrivial
The number of non-trivial (i.e., non singleton) strongly connected components of nodes. [Integer]

@item scc_trivial
The number of trivial (i.e., singleton) strongly connected components of nodes. [Integer]
@end ftable


@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------


@node Exit and Error Codes
@chapter Exit and Error Codes


@section Exit Codes

Wendy will exit with code @samp{0} in case everything went fine. That is, the command-line parameters were valid, the input open net could be read, the reachability graph of the inner could be build, the operating guidelines could be calculated, and---if requested---output files could be successfully written. In case any error occurs, the exit code will be @samp{1} and an error message with an error code (see below) will be printed to the standard error stream.

Note that Wendy's exit code is @b{not} related to the result of the controllability result. The messages

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: net is controllable: YES
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

and

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: net is controllable: NO
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

both yield exit code @samp{0} (successful termination).


@section Error Codes

In case any error occurs, Wendy aborts with exit code @samp{1} and prints a message with an error code to the standard error stream.

@table @asis
@item #01
Error opening the input open net or input file not found.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: could not open file `foo.owfn' -- aborting [#01]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #02
Error parsing the input open net. Usually indicates the line of the error and some more or less helpful message on the parse error.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy:13: error near `Place': syntax error, unexpected IDENT,
          expecting KEY_INTERFACE or KEY_PLACE -- aborting [#02]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #03
The input open net is not normal. That is, it contains a transition that is connected to more than one interface place. Note that non-normal open net can be normalized using the frontend tool @samp{petri} of the Petri Net @acronym{API}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: the input open net must be normal -- aborting [#03]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #04
At most one file can be read at once. If no input filename is given, the open net is read from standard input.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: at most one input file must be given -- aborting [#04]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #05
@i{This error code is deprecated since version 1.5.}

@item #06
This error occurs in case Wendy could not parse the reachability graph from LoLA. This might happen if a wrong version of LoLA (e.g., not using the @samp{STATESPACE} mode, see @ref{Requirements}) is used or LoLA runs out of memory. To get the exact parse error, use the command-line option @samp{--verbose}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: error while parsing the reachability graph -- aborting [#06]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #07
A wrong command-line parameter was given or there was a problem with the combination of command-line parameters. This message is usually accompanied by another message describing the exact problem. Run @samp{wendy --help} for an overview of the valid command-line parameters.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: `--showEmptyNode' option depends on option `dot'
wendy: invalid command-line parameter(s) -- aborting [#07]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #08
The report frequency for built knowledges must be a positive number. To switch off reporting at all, use @samp{--reportFrequency=0}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: report frequency must not be negative -- aborting [#08]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #09
Interface markings are stored in byte vectors, so the marking of each place has to be stored in one byte. Hence, the message bound must not exceed 255.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: message bound must be between 1 and 255 -- aborting [#09]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #10
@i{This parameter is deprecated since version 2.6.}

@item #11
Error opening a file to write. Usually, this error occurs in case Wendy is called in a directory without writing permissions or the output file is already present, but write protected. Output files can be the target files of the @option{--og} or @option{--dot} parameter as well as the temporary LoLA file @file{tmp.lola} or the generated cover constraint file @file{ogfile.cover}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: could not write to file `foo.og' -- aborting [#11]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #12
Wendy can either create operating guidelines or a service automaton. The options @option{--og} and @option{--sa} are mutually exclusive.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: `--og' and `--sa' parameter are mutually exclusive -- aborting [#12]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #13
Wendy cannot create a temporary file @file{/tmp/wendy-XXXXXX}, where @samp{XXXXXX} is replaced by a unique name. If this error occurs, check whether the @file{/tmp} folder exists and you have the rights to write there. One reason for this error can be that you are running Wendy under Windows (outside Cygwin), where UNIX-style path names are not recognized. In that case, try using the @option{--tmpfile} parameter. In case you provide a filename without @samp{XXXXXX} suffix, make sure this file does not already exist.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: could not create a temporary file `/tmp/wendy-k4CS4x' -- aborting [#13]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

The parameter @option{--verbose} can give you additional information on the nature of the error, e.g. `Permission denied' or `File exists'.

@item #14
Wendy cannot find the configuration file given by @file{--config} parameter or it has syntax errors. For an example configuration file, see the standard configuration file @file{src/wendy.conf} created by the configure script. See @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html#Configuration-files} for more information on configuration file.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: Error opening configuration file `myconf.conf'
wendy: error reading configuration file `myconf.conf' -- aborting [#14]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #15
Wendy cannot find the cover file given by @option{--cover} parameter or it has syntax errors. 

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: could not open cover file `foo.cov' -- aborting [#15]
wendy: error while parsing the cover file -- aborting [#15]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #16
A node that has to be covered (by using the @option{--cover} parameter) does not occur in the given net.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: unknown place `p' in file `foo.cov' -- aborting [#16]
wendy: unknown transition `t' in file `foo.cov' -- aborting [#16]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #17
A marking activates two transitions with the same synchronous label. This is not an error of the input net, but a situation Wendy cannot handle due to design decisions. It might be resolved in later versions. See @url{https://gna.org/bugs/?14719} for more information.

@smallexample
@cartouche
wendy: synchronous label `a' of transition `t' already used in this
       marking -- aborting [#17]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@end table

@chapter Version History

@c !!! DO NOT CHANGE THE NEXT LINE -- IT IS USED AS A FILTER IN SCRIPTS !!!
Wendy is developed under the ``Release Early, Release Often'' maxime (see @url{http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html}): Whenever enough integrated or a non-trivial changes have summed up, a new version is published. Though this releases might now always mark significant changes, they at least allow to quickly fix bugs and avoid infinite procrastination.
