@chapter First Steps

@section Setup and Installation

@enumerate
@item Go to @url{http://service-technology.org/files/wendy} and download the latest release version of Wendy, say @file{wendy-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz}. To setup and compile Wendy, change into your download directory and type

@cartouche
@smallexample
tar xfz wendy-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
cd wendy-@value{VERSION}
./configure
make
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

After compilation, a binary @samp{src/wendy} is generated.@footnote{On Microsoft Windows, the file will be called @file{wendy.exe}.} If you experience any compiler warnings, don't panic: Wendy contains some generated or third party code that we cannot influence.

@item To install the binary, the manpage, and the documentation, type

@cartouche
@smallexample
make install
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

You might need superuser permissions to do so.
@end enumerate

If you need any further information, see file @file{INSTALL} for detailed instructions.


@section Contents of the Distribution

@table @file

@node ChangeLog
@chapter Version History

Wendy is developed under the ``Release Early, Release Often'' maxime (see @url{http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html}): Whenever enough integrated or a non-trivial changes have summed up, a new version is published. Though this releases might now always mark significant changes, they at least allow to quickly fix bugs and avoid infinite procrastination.
