[EXIT STATUS]
Wendy exits with 0 on success, and with 1 if an error occurs. See Texinfo manual for detailed information. Note that the exit code is not correlated to the controllability result.

[EXAMPLES]
To calculate the operating guidelines of a service `service.owfn', execute
.IP
wendy service.owfn --og
.PP
The operating guidelines will be written to the file `service.og'.

[FILES]
Unless a configuration file is explicitly given using the
.B --config
parameter, Wendy first tries to parse file
.I wendy.conf
from the sysconf directory (usually `/usr/local/etc') and then from the current working directory.

[REPORTING BUGS]
If you experience a bug, please execute
.IP
wendy --bug
.PP
and send the generated file
.I wendy.conf
together with a description of the problem to
.B wendy@service-technology.org.
At https://gna.org/bugs/?group=service-tech you can see a list of open bugs.
