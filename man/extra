[EXIT STATUS]
Wendy exits with 0 on success, and with >0 if an error occurs. See Texinfo manual for detailed information. Note that the exit code is not correlated to the controllability result.

[EXAMPLES]
To calculate the operating guidelines of a service `service.owfn', execute
.IP
wendy service.owfn --og
.PP
The operating guidelines will be written to the file `service.og'.

[FILES]
Unless a configuration file is explicitly given using the
.B --config
parameter, Wendy first tries to parse file
.B wendy.conf
from the sysconf directory (usually `/usr/local/etc') and then from the current working directory.

[BUGS]
See https://gna.org/bugs/?group=service-tech for open bugs.
