Version 1.9-unreleased
======================

* added file `THEORY' listing the scientific algorithms and results
  implemented in Wendy

* implemented cover constraints for operating guidelines (parameter
  `--cover'); see file `THEORY' for more information

* canonized Makefiles and indicated which parts are purely generic

* refined statistics on the nodes: how many nodes were deleted and how many
  nodes remained? - adjusted test cases accordingly

* implemented the generation of livelock free partners (not yet operating
  guidelines); here, LoLA has to be configured appropriately by using
  directive STATESPACE rather than FULL (make lola-statespace) and the
  configuration file of Wendy has to be adjusted accordingly

* added test cases for livelock freedom

* fixed bug #14150 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14150'): empty node is only
  printed if it is reachable from the initial node

* updated maintainer scripts to support Launchpad

* implemented reduction rule "smart sending event" (parameter:
  `--smartSendingEvent'): a sending event is only considered if from the
  inner markings within the current knowledge (1) in case of deadlock
  freedom, some (inner) marking is reachable; (2) in case of livelock
  freedom, a final (inner) marking is reachable.

* added test cases for reduction rule "smart sending event"


Version 1.8
===========

* implemented reduction rule "sequentializing receiving events" (parameter:
  `--seqReceivingEvents'): instead of receiving messages in any order, only
  one sequentialization is considered. (A similar rule is implemented in
  Fiona where receiving events where combined rather than sequentialized.)

* implemented reduction rule "succeeding sending event" (parameter:
  `--succeedingSendingEvent'): once a sending event has led from the
  current knowledge to a valid successor knowledge, we do not consider any
  other sending event leaving the current knowledge

* fixed `--bug' parameter which caused segmentation faults on some machines

* added test cases for the reduction rules

* imported fixed Petri Net API: bug #14116 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14116')
  yielded incorrect results, because Wendy did not recognize unnormal input
  files

Version 1.7
===========

* added test case for bug #13903 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13903')

* fixed bug #14025 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14025'): the Dot output had
  problems with nonempty knowledge with true annotation

* fixed bug #14067 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14067'): a change in the Petri
  Net API broke the evaluation of final conditions

* added new version of the Petri Net API (after fixing bug #13844
  (`http://gna.org/bugs/?13844')

* made some adjustments which allow for a native Windows compilation
  (independent of `cygwin1.dll')

* added details to the man page; a PDF version of the man page can be
  created with `make man-pdf' in the `man' directory (requires groff and
  ps2pdf)

* small fix to allow compilation under x86_64 architectures

Version 1.6
===========

* fixed bug #13994 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13994') - malicious root node
  (i.e., a root not with reachable deadlocks or message bound violation)
  was not detected

* added more test cases for synchronous communication

* added a utility to minimize operating guidelines (see `utils/minimize') -
  this is currently an adjusted branch of Rachel which needs some polishing
  towards the new file formats

* added `--bug' option to create debug output

* using generic functions to display verbose status messages

* added status messages for nets with large inner state space

Version 1.5
===========

* fixed bug #13718 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13651') - fixed bit annotations

* fixed bug #13903 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13903') - filename of the
  temporary files can be passed to Wendy using the `--tmpfile' parameter

* used `mkstemp' function to create temporary filenames

* a wrapper script checks whether binaries needed by test cases are present
  and skips the test if necessary

* added improved Petri Net API files (faster parsing)

* updated maintainer scripts

* Wendy can be configured with a configuration file, provided by parameter
  `--config' (see
  `http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html#Configuration-files'
  for more information). A standard configuration is created by the
  configure script and written to `src/wendy.conf'. When Wendy is executed,
  it checks for the file `wendy.conf' in the sysconfig folder (usually
  `/usr/local/etc') and in the current directory. If neither file was
  found, Wendy tries to rely on standard options.

Version 1.4
===========

* versions of used programs are collected in `testsuite.log' when running
  `make check'

* service automata (a.k.a. interaction graphs) can be created with `--sa'

* fixed bug #13651 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13651') - adjusted parser to
  process empty markings

* added parameter `--mi' to store a mapping between the inner marking
  identifiers (integers) to actual Petri net markings (multisets of place
  names)

* added a hidden parameter `--im' to store information needed by Mia
  (`http://service-technology.org/mia') to calculate information for
  instance migration

Version 1.3
===========

* implemented the `receive before send' reduction rule
  (`--receiveBeforeSend'): if the waitstates of a knowledge bubble can be
  resolved by receiving, don't send - this reduction does not preserve all
  strategies, but will return a strategy if one exists

* implemented the `don't send in advance' reduction rule
  (`--waitstatesOnly'): only send a message to a knowledge bubble if it
  immediately resolves a waitstate - this reduction does not preserve all
  strategies, but will return a strategy if one exists

Version 1.2
===========

* implemented new OG file format - the deprecated format can still be used
  with `--fionaFormat' parameter which is implicitly used in case `-t OG'
  is used

* added "watermark" to generated operating guidelines (generator, platform,
  invocation string)

* using a GNU Autoconf's Autotest test suite

* the configure script checks if the Petri Net API was found and only
  compiles the local copy if necessary

Version 1.1
===========

* implemented synchronous communication

* renamed `--showDeadlocks' to `--showWaitstates'

* the list of interface labels are printed when `--verbose' is used

Version 1.0
===========

* initial release of Wendy

* calculates the operating guidelines of a normal open net

* result can be written in Fiona's OG format (with explicit formulae or 2
  bit representation)
