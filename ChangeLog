Version 3.0-unreleased (17 December 2009)
=========================================

* introducing the livelock operating guideline: use `--correctness=livelock
  --og' to calculate the livelock operating guideline with appropriate
  annotations which are then printed out in the og-file; providing
  parameter `--dot' prints the respective annotations in the dot output

* implemented parameter `--pnml' to read a PNML file format

Version 2.7 (17 December 2009)
==============================

* configure Wendy with `--enable-syslog' to additionally write verbose
  output to the syslog (e.g. `/var/log/system.log')

* `--reportFrequency' sets the number of edges to be reported (was: number
  of knowledges)

* fixed bug #14922 (see `https://gna.org/bugs/?14922'): Wendy could not
  process markings with Unicode place names which yielded a crash when
  using `--mi'

* moved the utility to minimize operating guidelines to the `ogapi' trunk
  (see `http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/service-tech/trunk/ogapi/')

Version 2.6 (23 November 2009)
==============================

* implemented user-defined data structure for the queue used in the closure
  operation

* discontinued deprecated output of operating guidelines in Fiona's file
  format (parameter `--fionaFormat') - this can be done with the compiler
  `wendy2fiona'

* discontinued output of bit operating guidelines (parameter
  `--formula=bits') - this can be done with the compiler `wendyFormula2bits'

Version 2.5 (21 November 2009)
==============================

* Wendy expects LoLA to omit printing out statistical data; usage of LoLA
  1.14 is required

* fixed bug #14798 (see `https://gna.org/bugs/?14798'): smart sending is
  too strict (now fix of bug #14782 is obsolete and is handled with the new
  implementation)

* fixed bug #14782 (see `https://gna.org/bugs/?14782'): smart sending event
  does not handle self loops of inner markings correctly

* added an error message to avoid segmentation faults in case a marking has
  two outgoing transitions with the same synchronous label (see
  `https://gna.org/bugs/?14719')

Version 2.4 (9 November 2009)
=============================

* added target for benchmarks (execute `make bench -C tests')

* implemented new 3-bit representation: at `T' bit is necessary to
  correctly cope with "true"-annotated nodes - renamed `2bits' option to
  `bits'

* removed explicit `std::flush' calls

* colored status messages

* fixed bug #14693 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14693'): wrong propagation of
  final states yielded wrong results for livelock freedom

Version 2.3 (21 October 2009)
=============================

* knowledge bubbles are finally sorted to avoid duplicates

* implemented first diagnosis functions: the `--diagnosis' parameter
  creates a Dot file which indicates the blacklisted markings

* removed all memory leaks

* removed parameter `--smartSendingEvent': Wendy will always use this
  technique unless `--ignoreUnreceivedMessages' is given

* renamed parameter `--receiveBeforeSend' to `--receivingBeforeSending'

Version 2.2 (16 September 2009)
===============================

* added test cases for checking synchronous communication together with
  livelock freedom and reduction rule "quit as soon as possible"
  (parameter: `--quitAsSoonAsPossible')

* added test cases to test Wendy's integration into Marlene

* no output files are created in case of uncontrollability (unless
  `--diagnose' is given)

* implemented parameter `--stats' to display information on runtime and
  memory consumption (the latter uses `ps' and does not work under Cygwin)

* `--verbose' is passed to LoLA

Version 2.1 (6 September 2009)
==============================

* fixed (known) issues concerning reduction rule "succeeding sending event"
  (parameter: `--succeedingSendingEvent')

* issues on the hidden parameter "quit as soon as possible" (parameter:
  `--quitAsSoonAsPossible') have been fixed

* implemented on-the-fly knowledge analysis

* added test case with insane nontrivial TSCC

* integrated LoLA SCCs detection within inner markings

* generated temporary files are always deleted unless the `--noClean'
  parameter is given; removed parameter `--clean'

* fixed 64-bit support: Wendy natively supports 32 and 64 bit compilations
  using GCC's switches `-m32' and `-m64', respectively. To successfully
  execute `make check', you need to compile the Petri Net API and Mia with
  the same options.

* allocated memory can be released using the (undocumented) parameter
  `--finalize'; fixed most memory leaks

* simplified interface to `Output' class managing file output

Version 2.0 (26 August 2009)
============================

* removed parameter `--noDeadlockDetection'

* reorganized internal livelock detection; avoided additional bit to be
  stored for each internal marking

* fixed bug #14166 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14166'): adding dead dummy
  transition to avoid parser errors from LoLA

* added scripts to use LCOV
  (`http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php') to determine test case
  coverage (use `make cover' in `tests' directory)

* added test cases to test Wendy's integration into Mia
  (`http://service-technology.org/mia')

* solved task #6701 (`https://gna.org/task/?6701'): output files (including
  temporary files) are now organized by dedicated class; `mktemp' function
  is used due to portability issues

* output can be piped to standard output (`stdout') by using the filename
  `-'; example: `wendy file.owfn --og=-'

* generated temporary files are deleted if the `--clean' parameter is given

* fixed bug #14158 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14158'): removed conflicts in
  graph grammar

Version 1.9 (21 August 2009)
============================

* added file `THEORY' listing the scientific algorithms and results
  implemented in Wendy

* implemented cover constraints for operating guidelines (parameter
  `--cover'); see file `THEORY' for more information

* canonized Makefiles and indicated which parts are purely generic

* refined statistics on the nodes: how many nodes were deleted and how many
  nodes remained? - adjusted test cases accordingly

* implemented the generation of livelock free partners (not yet operating
  guidelines); here, LoLA has to be configured appropriately by using
  directive STATESPACE rather than FULL (make lola-statespace) and the
  configuration file of Wendy has to be adjusted accordingly

* added test cases for livelock freedom

* fixed bug #14150 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14150'): empty node is only
  printed if it is reachable from the initial node

* updated maintainer scripts to support Launchpad

* implemented reduction rule "smart sending event" (parameter:
  `--smartSendingEvent'): a sending event is only considered if from the
  inner markings within the current knowledge (1) in case of deadlock
  freedom, some (inner) marking is reachable; (2) in case of livelock
  freedom, a final (inner) marking is reachable.

* added test cases for reduction rule "smart sending event"

* updated author/copyright information

* enhanced early insane node detection when reduction rule "smart sending
  event" is switched on; here for each full marking contained within a
  knowledge it is checked whether from the corresponding inner marking a
  transition is reachable that will consume an input message lying on the
  interface

Version 1.8 (13 August 2009)
============================

* implemented reduction rule "sequentializing receiving events" (parameter:
  `--seqReceivingEvents'): instead of receiving messages in any order, only
  one sequentialization is considered. (A similar rule is implemented in
  Fiona where receiving events where combined rather than sequentialized.)

* implemented reduction rule "succeeding sending event" (parameter:
  `--succeedingSendingEvent'): once a sending event has led from the
  current knowledge to a valid successor knowledge, we do not consider any
  other sending event leaving the current knowledge

* fixed `--bug' parameter which caused segmentation faults on some machines

* added test cases for the reduction rules

* imported fixed Petri Net API: bug #14116 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14116')
  yielded incorrect results, because Wendy did not recognize unnormal input
  files

Version 1.7 (10 August 2009)
============================

* added test case for bug #13903 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13903')

* fixed bug #14025 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14025'): the Dot output had
  problems with nonempty knowledge with true annotation

* fixed bug #14067 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?14067'): a change in the Petri
  Net API broke the evaluation of final conditions

* added new version of the Petri Net API (after fixing bug #13844
  (`http://gna.org/bugs/?13844')

* made some adjustments which allow for a native Windows compilation
  (independent of `cygwin1.dll')

* added details to the man page; a PDF version of the man page can be
  created with `make man-pdf' in the `man' directory (requires groff and
  ps2pdf)

* small fix to allow compilation under x86_64 architectures

Version 1.6 (21 July 2009)
==========================

* fixed bug #13994 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13994') - malicious root node
  (i.e., a root not with reachable deadlocks or message bound violation)
  was not detected

* added more test cases for synchronous communication

* added a utility to minimize operating guidelines (see `utils/minimize') -
  this is currently an adjusted branch of Rachel which needs some polishing
  towards the new file formats

* added `--bug' option to create debug output

* using generic functions to display verbose status messages

* added status messages for nets with large inner state space

Version 1.5 (9 July 2009)
=========================

* fixed bug #13718 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13651') - fixed bit annotations

* fixed bug #13903 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13903') - filename of the
  temporary files can be passed to Wendy using the `--tmpfile' parameter

* used `mkstemp' function to create temporary filenames

* a wrapper script checks whether binaries needed by test cases are present
  and skips the test if necessary

* added improved Petri Net API files (faster parsing)

* updated maintainer scripts

* Wendy can be configured with a configuration file, provided by parameter
  `--config' (see
  `http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html#Configuration-files'
  for more information). A standard configuration is created by the
  configure script and written to `src/wendy.conf'. When Wendy is executed,
  it checks for the file `wendy.conf' in the sysconfig folder (usually
  `/usr/local/etc') and in the current directory. If neither file was
  found, Wendy tries to rely on standard options.

Version 1.4 (15 June 2009)
==========================

* versions of used programs are collected in `testsuite.log' when running
  `make check'

* service automata (a.k.a. interaction graphs) can be created with `--sa'

* fixed bug #13651 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13651') - adjusted parser to
  process empty markings

* added parameter `--mi' to store a mapping between the inner marking
  identifiers (integers) to actual Petri net markings (multisets of place
  names)

* added a hidden parameter `--im' to store information needed by Mia
  (`http://service-technology.org/mia') to calculate information for
  instance migration

Version 1.3 (22 May 2009)
=========================

* implemented the `receive before send' reduction rule
  (`--receiveBeforeSend'): if the waitstates of a knowledge bubble can be
  resolved by receiving, don't send - this reduction does not preserve all
  strategies, but will return a strategy if one exists

* implemented the `don't send in advance' reduction rule
  (`--waitstatesOnly'): only send a message to a knowledge bubble if it
  immediately resolves a waitstate - this reduction does not preserve all
  strategies, but will return a strategy if one exists

Version 1.2 (20 May 2009)
=========================

* implemented new OG file format - the deprecated format can still be used
  with `--fionaFormat' parameter which is implicitly used in case `-t OG'
  is used

* added "watermark" to generated operating guidelines (generator, platform,
  invocation string)

* using a GNU Autoconf's Autotest test suite

* the configure script checks if the Petri Net API was found and only
  compiles the local copy if necessary

Version 1.1 (12 May 2009)
=========================

* implemented synchronous communication

* renamed `--showDeadlocks' to `--showWaitstates'

* the list of interface labels are printed when `--verbose' is used

Version 1.0 (11 May 2009)
=========================

* first official release of Wendy

* calculates the operating guidelines of a normal open net

* result can be written in Fiona's OG format (with explicit formulae or 2
  bit representation)
