                      synthesizing partners for services
                      http://service-technology.org/wendy


PURPOSE
    Wendy is a tool to synthesize partners for services. This includes a
    finite characterization of all partners (called "operating guidelines").
    Wendy uses a vast set of reduction rules to synthesize (small) 
    partners. These rules may, however, not preserve all partners of the
    service under consideration, but will synthesize a partner if one exists.
