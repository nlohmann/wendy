INSTALLATION
    Wendy can be easily compiled and installed. See file "INSTALL" for
    instructions.
    
    Wendy uses LoLA to build a reachability graph. Wendy searches for a LoLA
    binary "lola-full" during the configuration. A suitable LoLA binary can
    be created as follows:
     * download http://service-technology.org/files/lola/lola.tar.gz
     * untar lola.tar.gz, configure
     * call "make lola-full"
     * copy the binary "src/lola-full" to a directory of your path
       (e.g., /usr/local/bin)
    
    Wendy uses a lot of generated code. If you want to make changes to the
    source code, you might need the following tools to regenerate the code:
     * Flex (http://flex.sourceforge.net)
     * Bison (http://www.gnu.org/software/bison)
     * Gengetopt (http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt)
